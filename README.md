# Modelling-Australian-Colonization
Produced for class "Numerical Modelling" at KU Leuven/ Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Models historic indigenous populations across the Australian continent, using a number of inputs and a cellular modelling space. Model developed in accordance with findings by [Bird, et al. (2016)](http://science.sciencemag.org.kuleuven.ezproxy.kuleuven.be/content/352/6281/84).

Videos showing the results of the models and the dispersal of indigenous communities over 5000 years can be found [here](https://youtu.be/dTQZgw5mCF8) (water availability is related to distance to coast) and [here](https://youtu.be/N8KD8XGISFo) (water availability also related to presence of springs in interior of australian continent).
